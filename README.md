### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I am JosÃ© Luis.

I am an electronic engineer that ended up working as a software developer,  And I Love it! 

I am currently the Technical lead at [Swapps](https://swapps.com/) and have been working there since 2015. I love learning constantly and Swapps has been the best site for that.

I like to work mainly on **python and Django**, but I have experience with other programming languages and frameworks such as:

- python | Django, Flask, pyqt, DRF, ansible (and a big etc. :grimacing:)
- php    | wordpress, Drupal (not a big etc, but still etc. :sweat_smile:)
- JS     | Vue, React, React native, angular (a regular etc. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)

Feel free to ask me for help on one of these topics, I will help you gladly if I am able to. You may also check the [posts](https://swapps.com/blog/author/jariza/) I have written about technology in Swapps.


As well, I am currently learning some other tools such as rust, elixir, web assembly, machine learning, video games development, and a big etc. I am in constant learning :books:

Although my Open Source contributions are not as many as I would like to, I am always looking to collaborate with projects that will help communities and people to solve critical problems through technology. If you feel that I may help you with a project with these characteristics, please contact me.

Other facts about me:

- I play alto saxophone :saxophone: and guitar :guitar:
- I love reading
- I love video games
- I love one piece :skull: :anchor:

And That's it! Happy coding!
